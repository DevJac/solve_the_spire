A Slay the Spire AI
===================

Setup
-----

Install Slay the Spire. Install [Communication Mod](https://github.com/ForgottenArbiter/CommunicationMod), and optinally [SuperFastMode](https://github.com/Skrelpoid/SuperFastMode). I installed them from the Steam Workshop.

Setup this Julia environment as usual.

Usage
-----

Configure Communication Mod to run `relay.jl`, and then run `agent.jl`.
